   Recently, Ifoods chain signed the relevant strategic cooperation agreement. The super probe food fast inspection system under the food safety chain will be the only designated food safety partner by the "fifty-sixth national track and field sports meeting of capital higher school" sponsored by Chinese People's Public Security University to ensure the smooth progress of the competition.

<p class="MsoListParagraph">
  As a traditional sports event with a long history of 63 years, it is one of the favorite sports events of young students in the capital, who love sports. In 2018, the fifty-sixth Beijing University track and field sports meeting will be hosted by Chinese People's Public Security University. At that time, more than 70 colleges and universities in the capital will attend the conference.

</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">
 Ifoods chain is a scientific and technological enterprise using structured central data + intelligent hardware + block chain technology in food fast inspection, and is committed to become a block chain standard maker in the global food field. The super probe food quick inspection system by Ifoods chain for this sports meeting. It is portable and easy to operate.

</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">
    In use, the high precision sensing device will detect all kinds of structured data of food by using the hardware super probe connected to the mobile Dapp Bluetooth, and compare the data with Ifoods chain in the global collection of structured food database. Through a built-in algorithm, the data will eventually be told the consumers what the quality of the food within 60-120 seconds is. In the future, meat, seafood, fruits and vegetables can be quickly detected by this super probe.
</p>
<p class="Default" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:21.0pt;">
    Behind the food quality judgement which assist users quickly and intuitively, super probeshave merged a lot of new technologies. According to Kallon, a founder of Ifoods chain, "super probe is an intelligent hardware based on large data analysis, high precision MEMS sensing chip, block chain, large structured central database mining and other new technologies. It has good performance in reliable data, easy operation and lift efficiency."

</p>
<p class="Default" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:21.0pt;">
It is reported that both sides of the Ifoods chain and the Chinese People's Public Security University will cooperate more widely in the field of food safety application research in the new food technology + block chain in the field of food safety. In the future, Ifoods chain will develop the central database of meat, aquatic and organic food. It is believed that the rapid detection of organic food will become a reality in the near future and provide more security for the global organic food consumers.

    <span>26<sup>th</sup>, March. People’s Daily Online report (reporter Li
Tong), At present, Blockchain has become a fashionable hot word. Business pays
more attention to technology than it does, as if the block chain is

chaining technology change from concept to application? What bottlenecks are

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b><span>From “demonize” to
“apotheosis”: How to look at the block chain?</span></b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Previously, Bitcoin and ICO's " quick profit" made the
block chain into the public view.To block chain turn pale at the only mention
of something terrible, it is demonized; all kinds of industries talk about the
combination of block chain and think that it is a sharp weapon for turning
corners, deified it and thought it was omnipotent.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <a name="_GoBack"></a><b><span>What is
block chain in the end? Will it become a new outlet?</span></b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>At the "2018 China Development Forum" which was held
recently, the Ant Financial CEO Jin Xiandong said that the core of the block
chain is to create multiparty trust mechanism with technology, solve the
credible problems of data, goods, assets and people, and to promote efficient
collaboration across institutions and individuals.With the acceleration of the
global digitalization process, block chain technology will become the
cornerstone of the trust in digital society, so that participants can more
efficiently excavate the value behind data.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Chinese development forum is sponsored by the development research
center of the State Council, the topics on the forum represents the latest
thinking of the industry a certain extent.China is the largest market in the
application of block chain technology, and the global perspective is exploring
the "Chinese answer".</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Technology itself is not good or bad. The biggest bottleneck of
block chain is whether technology can break throughconstantly, and confusion
lies in the future application direction.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>"There is a proverb in the west, it is that don't throw
children away when you pour bath water.” Jacob Frankel, the president of J.P.Morgan
International, believes that any technology, from birth to application, needs
to be accumulated and excavated, and it is not easy to say that it is good or
bad.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Jing Xiandong thought that we should be vigilant against the fraud which
borrow the name of the block chain, and avoid the technology which produce
greater value became a victim. "At present, the block chain has not yet
found a large-scale commercial application scene, which is like the 90s
Internet bubble, businesses that have web pages call themselves Internet Co,
but they have no real value.With the burst of bubble, block chain technology
will usher in scale application in commercial field.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Where is the application of technology: not only looking up at the
starry sky, but “grounded”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>How to transform a technology into actual productivity and create
social value through business application is the urgent problem to solve in the
current block chain.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>People in the industry show how to innovate common understanding
algorithms, realize large-scale transaction processing capacity, improve
digital encryption and other technologies, not only make information
transparent and credible, but also guarantee personal privacy, and how to break
through the value transfer and data exchange between different block chains.All
of these are the directions that the industry is seeking to break through, and
also the inevitable answer to the progress of block chain technology.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>“The initial exploration of the technology of block chain is to make
the credibility of business more transparent and efficient, and promote the
continuous development of economic and social.” In Jing Xiandong's view, the
related exploration has begun in the field of public welfare, product
traceability, urban rental management and so on.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In the supply of high quality food, block chain technology has more
innovative practice."Because of the complex channel of product supply and
the high cost of tracing the source, it is a more operational measure of
controlling retail terminal for the enterprises registered with industry and commerce”.
Ifoodschain founder Kallon told reporters that block chain technology not only
allows consumers to participate in deep, create data and store data, but also
help food enterprises to improve the value of high quality products, avoid
"bad money to expel good money", and create an environment for the
development of the food industry.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Kallon said that, as an example of beef, through the probe testing
equipment with high precision sensor as the core component, the APP terminal is
connected to the mobile phone, and the quality information of the product can
be fed back to the consumer by the way that is closer to the consumer.Comparing
the tested products with the quality beef index, providing reference but
without conclusion.When the third party social organizations use beef quality
data, they will give back information providers through the form of payment,
and improve the incentive mechanism to form a closed loop. “By exploring the
operation process of block chain technology in the food industry, we set up the
‘China standard’ to provide reference for the global food industry.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>We can find a breakthrough by cognitive problems."Safety and
reliability, information protection, transaction performance and incentive
mechanism are the challenges for large-scale business applications of block
chain."Jing Xiandong believes that, for security, the security of the
algorithm, system security, protocol security, and so on are likely to be
attacked, while in the decentralization mode, there is no responsibility for people
or institutions that bear all responsibilities. In information protection,
there is a need to find solutions between sensitive information and business
secrets and multi stakeholder participation.In terms of transaction
performance, block chain needs multiple consensus, while the efficiency of multi-party
consensus transaction is low, and with the increase of node number, efficiency
decline is more obvious.On the incentive mechanism, we should also solve the
problem of benefit coordination and distribution on the block chain.</span>

    <span>December 27, 2008, the case of ‘Melamine milk powder’ that shocked
the whole country pushed food safety problem to public opinion.In the following
years, gutter oil, clenbuterol, industrial gelatin, sodium cyclamate, and
poisonous ginger. These food safety incidents have been exposed one by one.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span></span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In 2012, Kallon left the PR industry which worked more than ten
years, started a business in the field of Finance and agriculture. This year,
he also participated in the knowledge competition of the youth food safety as
an executive secretary. And the match was a great touch to him.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>"I found children know nothing at all about food
safety.Children should establish self-protective functions to themselves at
least. It's like language. We should educate children to care about their
bodies, children should know what to eat is good for their health, what they
eat is bad for their health.”</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Although the knowledge competition of the youth food safety didn't
go on for various reasons, Kallon remained in the food industry. Now he has
been in the food industry for nearly ten years, and he has witnessed and
participated in the efforts of practitioners in food safety.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Iterduo understands that, before that, the first reasonwhy food
safety problem is difficult to control is that no mutual trust mechanism. The
food field involves many aspects. The supply of food raw materials, the
production of food, the supply chain, all kinds of food enterprises, hardware
enterprises involved in the process of food circulation,many pain points are
urgently to be solved.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>As a public, distributed account, block chain is different from
centralization recording mode. The data source is single, and the data record
is consistent (by recording data at all nodes), so a clearer tracking channels
can be created in all links.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Therefore, by using block chain, food companies can trace back to
the source of food problemsmore quickly. This can not only reduce the risk of
consumers, provide security, but also reduce financial losses through a targeted
recall.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>And now, as the first inventor of Ifoods chain, Kallon has
accumulated many block chain related patents and software copyright.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">
    <b><span>Establishing internal trust mechanism in food industry, achieving
global food safety information sharing</span></b> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In December 2013, Central Bank of China issued “<i>ANotice on Preventing the Risk of Bitcoin</i>”, which made Kallonobserve
the block chain technology, whichforeshadowed the open of Ifoods chain.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>During the years of entrepreneurship in the food industry, Kallon
learned that, "for food companies, especially large food companies, they
are the least willing to produce food safety problems. But the bigger the
company is, the harder it is to manage the purchase and logistics. Many food
companies also face counterfeit products.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In fact, as early as 2012, the traceability mechanism of food safety
has been enforced. The main way of tracing is the origin of QR code.
Information about every link of food is input to the system, and users inquire
the source, transportation and other information of food through QR code.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>But QR codes are easily impersonate. The better brand and product
are, the easier it is to be counterfeited. Finally, the food enterprises will
be faced with the problem of being complained by consumers.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>But the problem is not limited to being counterfeited, QR code
traceability first needs consumers to scan the food source proactively, but the
consumer has not yet fully trained to scan the awareness of food, so even if
the enterprise bought the traceability system, its actual utilization rate is
very low.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In the construction of food safety ecosystem, the most important is
that data cannot be tampered. Traditional certificate of proof is not strict in
the past, because these evidences are very easy to be forged and destroyed.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Block chain technology happens to be able to solve this problem.When
food companies attach the label of the Internet of things to the goods, each
batch is assigned a unique identification number, which can record the source
of the product, the processing information, the storage temperature, shelf life
and other information. The whole process of record keeping is transparent.
Without any third party's intervention, it can prove the authenticity of the
information.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>As the food industry is a global circulation industry, a transparent
and reliable unified information platform can be obtained through the block
chain. It can view the state in real time, reduce the cost of logistics, trace
the production and transport of the whole process, so as to improve the
efficiency of supply chain management. When disputes occur, evidence and
tracing are also more clear and easy.</span>

    <span>It is understood that the large and internal processes have been
more scientific and systematic food companies have the motivation to use block
chain to improve the traceability of products. After joining the related block
chain, the probability of being wrongly killed when the above pain point occurs
is reduced.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>At the same time, the block chain platform of the food industry
helps to link the related enterprises and business entities in the food
industry chain, and ultimately helps to improve the quality of the global food
supply chain as a whole, and reduce the related asymmetry of the food industry
chain.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>At every stage of the supply chain, it can be recorded in the block
chain system, so that we can get real-time data of products and their
historical records at any time and anywhere.</span>

    <b><span>Researching and developing super probe, solving the last mile food
safety problems.</span></b> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>"After seeing the announcement of the central bank, I studied
it and found that its underlying block chain technology can help the food
industry do many things." By the end of 2015, Kallon began to build a
team, dedicated to solve the food safety in the last mile.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">
    The schematic diagram of super probes and mobile
terminals (as the core hardware of Ifoods chain, is very small in size and easy
to carry around).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Kallon tells iterduo, Ifoodschain has three
core functions: 1. improving the detection efficiency, 2. Improving food
productivity, 3. reducing the damage of the food industry.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>All the above traceability behaviors should
be based on solving the last mile to food safety problems. That is to say, only
consumers measure food can produce other functions including traceability,
supervision and big data.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>The development of super probe is based on
the last mile. In Kallon’s view, when the super probe can detect food
problemsaccurately, conveniently and efficiently. In that way, everyone should
have a super probe in their hands, because food safety concerns your whole family
health.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>With beef as an example, the quality of
meat is difficult to see with the naked eye, so when consumers go to the
supermarket to buy beef, they can measure with super probe first, through the
measurement, the results of are fed back to the cell phone finally. It tells
you whether the beef has been injected with water and contains lean meat
essence.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>It is understood that the current beef
detection is the first application of the Ifoods chain block chain ecological
platform.<a name="_GoBack"></a> Among the core developers of the team, 70 years
old American University of Georgia food science, the president of Newleigh
china proper, Dr. Lin Ruji, are also among them.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>It is revealed that the demo of super probe
will be launched in June of this year. It is estimated that in September, the
super probe will complete the test iteration.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">
    <b><span>Summarize</span></b> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Ifoods chain's team hopes to build an open
source and open type ecological platform of block chain for food and related fields.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In August 2017, 10 of the world's largest
retail and food suppliers were working together with IBM to integrate the block
chain into its supply chain. From then on, food suppliers would be able to
trace the ingredients more quickly.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>The ten companies include WAL-MART, Nestle,
Unilever, Mccormick, Tyson, Krogh, Mcclain, Driscoll, Dole and Jinzhou food,
and their annual global sales combined more than five trillion dollars. This
also seems to prove that block chain has certain positive effects on the field
of food safety.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In order to put the product information on
the block chain platform easily, the Ifoods chain team provides the Usp system
for the business, even if you are the technology green hand, it can also upload
food information to the block chain platform of the Ifoods chain at any time.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>This will give them the most efficient
access to the global food industry data, and help the food industry develop at
the bottom which Improve productivity and productivity to a certain extent.</span>
